# Post-build, pre-deploy check: verify every file touched by an overlay/patch_*.py
# is actually readable by the container's real runtime user, not just by root.
#
# Why this exists (2026-09-16): patch_apc_no_store.py's atomic_write() wrote its
# replacement file via tempfile.mkstemp() (mode 0600) + os.replace() (a rename,
# which installs the temp file's mode verbatim, not a copy that would keep the
# target's own mode). The Docker build applies every overlay/patch_*.py as root,
# so the resulting 0600-root-owned file was invisible there -- every self-check
# in the Dockerfile's own RUN step runs as root too. The container actually
# serves as a non-root user (uid:gid 1000:1000, matching the host `luser`
# account, passed via `docker run --user` at launch time -- NOT baked into the
# image, confirmed via `docker inspect <image> --format '{{.Config.User}}'`
# returning empty). That non-root process lost read access to a core vLLM file
# and the whole engine crashed with a bare PermissionError at first launch.
# This script catches that class of regression before it ever reaches a real
# boot. See recipes/VALIDATION.md, "Backport deployment incident, 2026-09-16".
#
# Usage: ./check_nonroot_permissions.sh [image_tag]
#   (default image_tag: glm53-exl3-v20-upstreamsync:local)
#
# Run this after every docker build that touches any overlay/patch_*.py,
# before deploying. Exits non-zero and prints exactly which file(s) a
# non-root runtime user can't read.
