# v20-upstreamsync: routine upstream check, four items folded in

Seeded from `recipes/build/glm53-exl3-v19-indexercompat` (current production).
Sourced from a routine upstream-check triage (2026-09-11) across MiaAI-Lab's
GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-2x-DGX-Sparks fork (`9c0794b..1caea9a`, 65 commits),
Enntity/sparkglm's `exl3` branch, and vLLM main since v0.29.0. Full triage in
this session's transcript; user selected items 1, 2, 5, 6 to fold in. Item 3
(DFlash2 drafter revision pin) was dropped after re-checking: this fork's
production speculator is MTP-2, not DFlash2 (DFlash2 caused two distinct
crash classes here, see `v19-indexercompat`'s own header comment) -- the
upstream bug doesn't apply to a code path we don't run. Item 4 (vLLM #54929)
is tracked separately, not yet folded in -- see its own section below.

## What this build changes

1. **Chat template `None` leak** (`files/chat_template.jinja`,
   upstream MiaAI-Lab#156 / `68ce597`). `visible_text()`'s catch-all branch
   was `{%- else -%}{{- content }}{%- endif -%}` -- when an assistant turn
   has `content: None` (tool-calls-only, common in agent traffic), this
   rendered the literal string `None` into the prompt. Fixed to
   `{%- elif content is not none -%}{{- content -}}{%- endif -%}`. Only the
   `None`-guard hunk was ported; #156's other hunks (early `break`s in the
   tool-call-ID sort loop, a `+`->`~` string-concat robustness tweak) target
   a version of the sort-loop structure that has already diverged here from
   independent local changes -- not ported, to avoid an anchor mismatch in
   code that no longer matches upstream's assumed shape. New regression test:
   `tests/test_chat_template.py::NullContentTests` (mutation-verified: fails
   against the pre-fix template with a literal `None` in the rendered output).

2. **`count_shards()` false-completeness bug** (`start.sh`, upstream
   MiaAI-Lab#153 / `c195e92`). The shard-completeness check counted
   `*.safetensors` recursively across *every* cached snapshot, not just the
   one `refs/main` resolves to -- stale shards from an old build (this fork
   has iterated v10->v20 on the same hosts) can satisfy the count while the
   *active* snapshot is actually incomplete, and the boot then fails deep
   inside vLLM load instead of fast with an actionable message. Fixed by
   resolving `refs/main` (falling back to the newest snapshot dir) first,
   then counting only within that one snapshot directory, non-recursively.
   **This fork's DFlash2 download-completeness check had the identical bug
   in a separate, non-shared code path** (`download_dflash()`'s inline
   `find "$DFLASH_PATH/snapshots" -name 'model.safetensors'`, not a call to
   `count_shards()`) -- not covered by upstream's PR (which only touched the
   shared function), fixed here too via a new `count_dflash_shard()` helper
   using the same resolved-ref logic. New test:
   `tests/test_snapshot_scoped_count.py` (covers both the target-model and
   DFlash2 call sites; mutation-verified against upstream's own fixture).

3. **`LONG_PREFILL_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` opt-in** (`start.sh`, `.env.example`,
   upstream MiaAI-Lab#157 / `d094362`). Plumbs vLLM's native
   `--long-prefill-token-threshold` flag through as a new env var, default
   empty (stock scheduler, zero behavior change unless set). Upstream's own
   measured A/B/A at `MNBT=7168`, `threshold=3584` (MNBT/2): warm-session
   freeze 131/108s -> 15s; contended prefill +6%; solo prefill +3..+11%
   (within baseline drift) -- a clean win in their numbers, not a tradeoff.
   **Left empty deliberately, not defaulted on**: this fork already ships
   its own answer to the identical "a long prefill freezes an already-warm
   decode session" symptom --
   `overlay/patch_scheduler_decode_floor.py`'s `GLM53_MIXED_PREFILL_WARM_TOKENS`
   (also defaulted to 3584, same problem framing) / `_MAX_WAIT_MS` /
   `_LATE_CAP` bypass-and-late-cap scheduler patch. Same symptom, two
   different mechanisms (a custom scheduler monkeypatch here vs. vLLM's
   native flag upstream) -- running both at once is untested and could
   double-throttle or interact unpredictably. **Do not set
   `LONG_PREFILL_TOKEN_THRESHOLD` non-empty without a real A/B against this
   fork's own mixed-prefill gate first.** New test:
   `tests/test_long_prefill_threshold.py` (validation range, both-rank argv
   wiring with the flag unset/empty/set, caller-override-wins-over-.env).

4. **`BUILD_MIN_MEM_GIB` build-host guard** (`start.sh`, `.env.example`,
   ported from Enntity/sparkglm `a8aaa229`, an *original* guard on their
   side, not copied external code -- their commit message states this
   explicitly). Native EXL3 compilation is CPU/RAM-intensive and can consume
   nearly all of GB10's unified memory; running `build_image()` (i.e.
   `docker build`) while a resident model server holds most of that memory
   risks swap-thrash or an outright OOM mid-build. `assert_build_headroom()`
   now runs at the top of `build_image()` and refuses the build below
   `BUILD_MIN_MEM_GIB` (default 32) `MemAvailable`, printing any running
   containers as a hint before dying; `BUILD_MIN_MEM_GIB=0` is the explicit
   override. Build-host-side only -- does not touch the serving/runtime path
   at all. New test: `tests/test_build_headroom.py`.

## Verification so far

All four items are source-level changes with new/adapted regression tests,
run directly against the host Python (no container needed for these --
they're pure bash-function and Jinja-template tests). All pass, including
the full pre-existing test suite in this directory (`test_numeric_config.py`,
`test_indexer_workspace.py`, `test_kpool_tail_slotmap.py`,
`test_mixed_prefill_gate_v2.py`, `test_start_overrides.py`,
`test_bringup_robustness.py`, etc. -- no regressions from the `start.sh`
edits). `test_ablit.py`, `test_exl3_overlay.py`, `test_hybrid_prefix_hit.py`,
`test_scheduler_decode_floor.py` need the actual container's installed
`torch`/`vllm` and weren't runnable on the host -- expected, not a failure.

## Docker build: PASSED (2026-09-11)

`docker build -t glm53-exl3-v20-upstreamsync:local .` -- 20.9 GB image, all
63 build steps succeeded including the full build-time self-test suite
(`test_exl3_overlay.py`, `test_suppress_stops.py`, `test_scheduler_decode_floor.py`,
`test_hybrid_prefix_hit.py`, `test_xgrammar_termination.py`,
`test_kpool_tail_slotmap.py`, `test_spinwait_patch.py`,
`test_indexer_workspace.py`, `test_ablit.py` -- all OK).

## tinyGLM gate: PASSED (2026-09-11)

`recipes/glm-5.3-flash-exl3-v20-tinyglm.yaml`, TP=2 across both hosts.
**First attempt crashed** during CUDA graph capture on the worker rank
(`torch.AcceleratorError: CUDA error: an illegal memory access was
encountered`, `Capturing CUDA graphs (PIECEWISE)`), which cascaded into the
head hanging on `shm_broadcast` waiting for the dead peer (repeated "No
available shared memory broadcast block found in 60 seconds" -- the
recurring #51921 symptom, here a downstream effect, not the root cause).
None of this build's four changes touch the CUDA-graph-capture path, and a
clean `sparkrun stop` + `prelaunch_flush.sh` + retry booted healthy in ~1.5
minutes with no recurrence -- treated as the same class of transient GB10
boot flakiness this project has hit before (see e.g. the v18-gb10gemm
validation's own isolated earlyoom incident, unrelated to that patch), not a
regression from this build. Worth remembering if it recurs on a future
candidate, but not chased further here.

**Second attempt, clean boot**: `/health` 200, two identical temp=0 chat
completions returned byte-identical output (determinism confirmed).
Dispatch-correctness confirmation lines present on **both** ranks, matching
v19-indexercompat's own pattern exactly: `glm53-kpool-tail-fix`,
`glm53-kpool-indexer-fix`, `glm53-mamba-race-fix`,
`glm53-mixed-prefill-env-fix`, `glm53-gb10-router-gemm`,
`glm53-indexer-workspace` (rightsize, 8192 entries), `glm53-fp8-lmhead-v4`
(scale_mode=tensor), `exl3.py` tier resolution
(`configured_tier=grouped effective_tier=grouped tier_reason=grouped_ok`),
and the mixed-prefill gate v2 config line (`warm_tokens=3584,
max_wait_ms=1500, late_cap=512` -- confirms `LONG_PREFILL_TOKEN_THRESHOLD`
being unset didn't disturb this fork's own gate). This is exactly the
regression-gate result predicted going in: nothing in this candidate's
four items touches tinyGLM's dispatch path, so a clean match to v19's known
pattern (not a byte-for-byte log diff against a saved v19 log, but the same
tier/config/confirmation lines) is the expected, confirmed outcome.

## Real-checkpoint validation: PASSED (2026-09-11)

Production was already idle (no traffic at the time), so no downtime
coordination was needed. `Mia-AiLab/GLM-5.3-Flash-EXL3-TR3-4bpw`, TP=2, same
flags as `v19-indexercompat`.

**Boot flakiness, 2/4 attempts across this whole validation session** (2
tinyGLM-adjacent -- see the tinyGLM section above -- would make it 2/5
counting that gate) hit `torch.AcceleratorError: CUDA error: an illegal
memory access was encountered` during CUDA graph capture on the worker rank.
Every occurrence recovered cleanly with `sparkrun stop` +
`prelaunch_flush.sh` + retry, no pattern tying it to this candidate's four
changes (none touch CUDA graph capture).

**`probe_sanity.py`: ALL PASSED.** Chat coherent, no reasoning leak,
finish_reason=stop, streaming TTFT 0.19-0.29s, decode throughput across two
separate clean boots: 28.17-29.99 tok/s (6 samples) -- matches
v19-indexercompat's own validated range (27.4-29.28 tok/s) with no
regression, plausibly a hair faster but within noise.

**Item 1 (chat template `None` fix) verified live, not just unit-tested.**
Sent a real tool-calling round-trip with an assistant turn carrying
`content: null` + `tool_calls` (exactly the shape that used to leak the
literal string `None`) followed by a tool response. Real checkpoint replied
coherently -- `"2 plus 3 equals **5**."` -- with no `None` artifact anywhere
in the output.

**`probe_longctx.py --tokens 16000`: a real, load-bearing finding that turned
out to be a false alarm, worth recording in full because the investigation
is the actual evidence, not just the verdict.** First two v20 attempts both
failed: `journalctl -u earlyoom` on the head node (10.7.0.87) showed
`sending SIGTERM to process ... "python3" ... mem 2.00%, swap 80.00%` each
time, killing the APIServer process itself and cascading into the familiar
NCCL/shm-broadcast teardown on the worker. Two failures in a row on the same
candidate is more than this project's documented precedent for this failure
class (e.g. v18-gb10gemm's validation hit it once, recovered on one retry) --
enough to treat as a real regression suspicion, not dismiss on priors. **Ran
a direct controlled comparison instead of assuming**: v19-indexercompat (current
production, completely unmodified) against the identical probe. First v19
attempt: clean pass, TTFT=10.3s, 4/4 codes, no earlyoom activity at all. A
third v20 attempt, same recipe, same image, no code change: clean pass,
TTFT=11.9s, 4/4 codes. A second v19 attempt: clean pass, TTFT=9.6s, 4/4
codes -- **but earlyoom fired mid-request anyway** (`sending SIGTERM to
process ... "python3" ... badness 989, VmRSS 4353 MiB`, killing some other
process, not the APIServer this time) with zero effect on the request's
outcome. **Conclusion: this is the same ambient, intermittent, fleet-wide
earlyoom margin issue already documented in `gmu_086_earlyoom_regression`
and `earlyoom_root_cause_correction` (thin memory headroom on the head node
under load, unrelated to which candidate is running) -- not a v20
regression.** It fired on v19 too, mid-request, with no correlation to which
image was serving. v20's own worse 2/3-run hit rate in this session reads as
unlucky timing on a noisy, pre-existing signal, not causation -- confirmed
by the fact the identical v20 image passed clean on its third attempt with
zero changes. TTFT@16K across all clean runs (both versions): 9.6-11.9s,
consistent with this project's previously-documented ~9.7-10.7s range for
this probe -- no throughput regression either.

## Verdict: recommend promotion

Correctness confirmed (including the live-verified None-leak fix), decode
and long-context throughput match production within noise, and the one
worrying signal during validation (repeated earlyoom on the longctx probe)
was run to ground with a direct controlled comparison and found to be
pre-existing fleet behavior affecting v19 exactly as it affects v20, not a
regression introduced by any of this candidate's four changes. No blocking
issues found. Boot flakiness (CUDA-graph-capture crash, ~2/5 attempts this
session) is also not new to this candidate -- recover via the standard
stop+flush+retry remedy, matching prior documented occurrences.

## Amendment 2026-09-11: dense-FP8 folded in, on by default

After the promotion above, per the user's explicit direction: ported
v16-densefp8's `overlay/exl3.py` dispatch logic (`Glm53DenseFp8Method`,
`_glm53_dense_fp8_group()`) plus `overlay/patch_dense_fp8.py` onto this
build (see the top-of-Dockerfile amendment header). Re-measured against
this exact image, not the stale v15-combined baseline the original A/B
used: decode +14-17%, prefill @64K -15.6% -- consistent with the original
(+12%/-14.7%), confirming no kernel work since (E3, GB10 router-GEMM,
FlashKDA, MoE-gate-dedup) shifted the tradeoff. Ran the coherence/accuracy
check this project's rules required and the original v16-densefp8 work
never completed (6 prompts incl. CJK, temp=0, on vs off) -- clean, no
garbling, no wrong answers. `glm-5.3-flash-exl3-v20-upstreamsync-vllm.yaml`
now ships `GLM53_DENSE_FP8=dense,kda` by default; a new sibling recipe
`glm-5.3-flash-exl3-v20-upstreamsync-maxprefill-vllm.yaml` keeps it off,
same image. Full record: `recipes/VALIDATION.md`, "Dense-FP8 promoted to
default, maxprefill sibling added".

## Item 4 (vLLM #54929) -- assessed, NOT vendored, real reasons found

Feasibility check completed 2026-09-11. **Verdict: not advisable to vendor
now.** The premise that motivated flagging this ("overlaps our existing
sparse-MLA/indexer patches") turned out to be wrong in a way that makes
things worse, not better:

- **Wrong backend, no overlap.** This fork's production attention path is
  `FlashInferMLASparseSM120Impl` (`flashinfer_mla_sparse.py`, forced via a
  ~140-line Dockerfile `RUN` block, plus `overlay/patch_nope_mqa_fix.py`).
  PR #54929 modifies `flashmla_sparse.py` (no "infer") -- a **different,
  currently-unused backend enum (`FLASHMLA_SPARSE`)**. Zero textual anchor
  conflict with `patch_indexer_workspace.py` (targets `indexer.py`) or
  `patch_kpool_tail_slotmap.py` (targets `block_table.py`) either. That
  sounds like good news but isn't: it means our runtime path never reaches
  any of this PR's code, so adopting it gets nothing for free -- our entire
  bespoke NoPE-on-SM120 story (zero-padding 512-dim NoPE into 576-wide
  GLM_NSA geometry, index_kpool=4 sizing, the 2048/2051 tail-truncation fix,
  GB10 DeepGEMM block-size alignment) would need to be **re-derived from
  scratch** against the PR's 6,848 new lines.
- **PR is unreviewed and has known, unfixed bugs.** Opened by a
  non-maintainer, `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED`, zero human reviews. CodeRabbit
  flagged real correctness bugs still open: a stride bug in `sm12x_mqa.py`
  (uses `head_dim` instead of `head_dim+4` for the indexer cache view --
  reads wrong bytes) and a missing-disable-flag bug in the b12x fast path
  (repeats a failed fast path every call instead of latching off).
- **Never tested against our config.** The PR's own test matrix is
  GLM-5.2-NVFP4 (non-NoPE, real RoPE dim) on 24x RTX 5090 -- not GB10, not
  NoPE/zero-padded, not `index_kpool>1`.
- **Root-cause match to #51921 is contested.** The issue's own top analysis
  describes idle shm_broadcast writer-starvation, later attributed by
  another commenter to client-abort accounting (host-side, zero GPU util).
  The PR author's corroborating report describes sustained-load kernel-launch
  livelock at 100% GPU util instead -- a different symptom. No maintainer has
  confirmed these are the same bug.
- **Version skew**: our base predates PR #51718 (pre-v0.29.0 lineage); this
  PR targets current `main`. Small hunks (`envs.py`, `sparse_attn_indexer.py`)
  are probably low-risk; the 6,800 lines of new kernel code depend on
  internal APIs not verified against our older base.

**Not folded into this build.** Revisit only after upstream review/merge (or
at least a maintainer confirming the #51921 root-cause match), and after
someone validates the Triton kernels against a NoPE/zero-padded,
`index_kpool>1` checkpoint like ours. The underlying operational problem
(#51921, recurring shm-broadcast stall) remains open and unfixed -- still
worth tracking, just not via this PR today.

## Amendment 2026-09-12: cudagraph_align hardening (patch_cudagraph_align.py)

Mined from AEON-7/vllm-ultimate-dgx-spark (see `recipes/VALIDATION.md`,
"AEON-7 initial triage"): `vllm/config/compilation.py`'s
`resolve_cudagraph_mode_and_sizes` only rounds `cudagraph_capture_sizes` to
multiples of `uniform_decode_query_len` (1 + num_speculative_tokens, = 3 for
this fleet's MTP-2) when `cudagraph_mode.decode_mode() == CUDAGraphMode.FULL`.
Every other decode mode silently skips the rounding, which the dispatcher's
own `_create_padded_batch_descriptor` then asserts on
(`assert num_tokens_padded % uniform_decode_query_len == 0`) for any uniform
decode batch. AEON-7's own patch text didn't apply byte-for-byte against
this image's vLLM commit (g487ecf187 adds a `not use_v2_model_runner` clause
their version predates), so `overlay/patch_cudagraph_align.py` here is a
from-scratch port matching our actual anchor, broadening the condition from
`decode_mode() == FULL` to `!= NONE`. Verified via `test_cudagraph_align.py`
(host fixture + a real extracted `compilation.py` from this exact image) and
via a full docker build (all existing self-checks + the new one pass).

**Important scope note**: this does NOT explain the 2026-09-12 23:41 UTC
production incident that prompted the investigation (`Worker proc
VllmWorker-0 died unexpectedly`, no traceback, exit code None). That crash
happened on a 5,832-token scheduled batch for a single request already at
179,200 computed tokens -- far above `max_cudagraph_capture_size=96`, so it
ran eager, never touching a captured graph. This patch is a confirmed,
independently-justified hardening (our own boot log shows
`cudagraph_mode=FULL_AND_PIECEWISE` resolves at boot, so the original
FULL-only gate is very likely already satisfied in normal operation -- this
change is a no-op in that case and only matters if some future config or
backend-support path ever leaves decode mode at PIECEWISE), not a fix for
that specific incident. See `recipes/VALIDATION.md` for the live
investigation into what actually caused it.

## Amendment 2026-09-15: two backports from a routine upstream-check round

Both mined from MiaAI-Lab main (`f906ee990..HEAD`, ~93 commits across two
consecutive rounds). Full round detail, including everything assessed and
NOT adopted, lives in `recipes/VALIDATION.md`.

**`patch_default_max_new_tokens.py`** (PR #51): decode-hygiene default for
requests that omit `max_tokens`. Gated behind `DEFAULT_MAX_NEW_TOKENS`
(unset/empty = stock behavior; this fleet ships `"65536"` in both the
default and maxprefill recipes' `env:` blocks). All three anchors
(`entrypoints/serve/utils/api_utils.py`'s `get_max_tokens()`,
`entrypoints/openai/completion/serving.py`'s call site,
`entrypoints/openai/completion/protocol.py`'s before-validator) verified
byte-for-byte against this image's own vLLM before being written -- zero
reconciliation needed. Ported near-verbatim (upstream's implementation was
already well-built: idempotent, validates `DEFAULT_MAX_NEW_TOKENS` and
compiles every target before writing any of the three files); only the
`ROOT` path was changed to be env-overridable
(`GLM53_VLLM_ROOT`), matching this project's own patch-testability
convention. Verified via `test_default_max_new_tokens.py` (real extracted
source, idempotency, `--status`, and invalid-input fail-closed checks) and
a full docker rebuild.

**`prelaunch_flush.sh`'s new `check_memory_available()`** (PR #39): a
pre-boot check, run on both hosts right after the existing drop_caches +
fragmentation steps, comparing `/proc/meminfo`'s `MemAvailable` against
`gpu_memory_utilization x MemTotal + headroom` (default 2 GiB). Catches a
host process holding memory -- not a container, which the existing
container-count check would miss -- BEFORE paying for the image pull and
weight load, rather than dying mid-bring-up with a hard-to-read `ValueError:
Free memory on device ... less than desired` deep in a worker log. FATAL by
default (`GLM53_PREFLIGHT_SKIP_MEMORY_CHECK=1` to override), unlike the
advisory-only fragmentation check next to it -- this failure mode is a
guaranteed deterministic hard-stop, not a probabilistic risk, so failing
fast is strictly better here. Deliberately reads `MemAvailable`, not
`MemFree`, for the same reason the fragmentation check does. Verified via
`bash -n` and a standalone arithmetic check against real host numbers; not
yet exercised against a live host (would require running
`prelaunch_flush.sh` against production, which was not done this round to
avoid disturbing live traffic -- first real exercise will be whenever this
fleet's next boot happens).

**Also assessed this round, not adopted**: PR #170 (long-prefill warmup
ladder extension), PR #94 (`GLM53_KV_CAPACITY_LOG`, informational-only),
PR #70 (`spec-accept-gate.sh` diagnostic + UVM-livelock runbook), PR #41
(`spark_doctor.sh` ops tooling) -- all genuinely low-risk and plausibly
worth adopting, just not done this round; PR #186/#187 (fair-v5
mixed-prefill scheduler, now MiaAI-Lab's own TP=2 default) -- explicitly
flagged as needing a deliberate A/B before adopting, not a drive-by
backport; the `thinking_token_budget` sampler bug flagged via a separate
mmastrac/4x-gx10 dig -- checked directly against our vendored vLLM and
confirmed NOT applicable, since it lives in vLLM's V2 model runner's
sampler and this fleet resolves to the V1 runner (structurally different
code, no shared bug). See `recipes/VALIDATION.md` for the full list.
