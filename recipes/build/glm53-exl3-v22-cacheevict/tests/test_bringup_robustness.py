"""Anchor checks for the bring-up robustness patches in start.sh.

Same static-analysis style as test_warm_restart_stdout.py: the launcher is a
generated-heredoc-heavy script, so these tests pin the markers that keep the
robustness behaviours wired (worker death detection, revision-keyed sync
marker, HF CLI fallback, worker cache writability preflight).
